### "the genius cannot know that he is a genius - not really: he has hopes, he has premonitions, he suffers raging paranoid doubts, but he can have, in the end, only himself for measurement."

It reads poetic. For me, I think it is not just about the genius, but also everyone. Everyone has moments of doubt or self-doubt. We will feel failure at these moments. If we take the emotion out of it, describing “failure” more objectively, it is more of our cognition of the current position: a position that is some distance from an ideal goal. It is not negative or positive, just an objective situation. But it is nice to realize our situation, which makes us to reflect and look for the reasons, alternative paths, new goals that lead/block us towards the ideal destination. Then we can take actions based on it and progress. As long as we doubt, or have higher goals, we will put ourselves in such a position, which is not failure, just a destination has not yet arrived.

### "Charlie is projecting values and life choices that they, themselves, may not necessarily endorse."
### "Can and should Charlie’s ends and means be made transparent to individual users? In your response, consider both the narrower and the richer definitions of transparency."

Personally, I feel these two concerns can be discussed together. It is dangerous for products to regard themselves as the “best” choice. I prefer that they are providing more options for users. I believe that users should have rights to make decisions for themselves, in the context of transparency. Transparency does not mean exposing the codings or algorithms, which is not understandable for most users. However, they can tell users what kind of data are being tracked and used (e.g. heart rate, medicines, text etc.), what results are generated based on those data. Meanwhile, users could have choices to stop tracking or using certain kinds of personal data. And they should be informed of the possible effects of doing so, such as a suboptimal treatment. They have the right to make their own choices and the responsibility to bear the consequences of their choices

### "It would be a struggle—perhaps impossible—to develop a categorization schema that did not offend anyone."

I do not think it is possible to develop a categorization schema that did not offend anyone. Because one categorization means a specific extraction of a complicated subject. So it is always one-sided. And different understandings of the subject will result in different categorizations. Thus, I would prefer stop categorization, and find an alternative method. The purpose of categorization is to have a quick knowledge of the subject, what it is, what its characteristics. So, in order to achieve this purpose, is it possible to use matching rate instead of categorization? Which sound data does the input sound match most? In this way, both people and the AI still could have a quick knowledge of the subject while it is not subject to the subjective judgment of human.
